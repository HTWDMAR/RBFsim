# RBFsim

RBFsim is an implementation of Analytic Element Method (AEM) for analyzing a very basic River Bank Filtration (RBF) scenario.

The current code can simulate:

1. Single and multiple (<6) wells
2. Calculate river water portion in the filterate
3. Calculate river capture length
4. Compute travel time for river water to the well
5. Include impact of riverbed clogging
6. Visualization (isolines streamlines etc) for the above scenario.

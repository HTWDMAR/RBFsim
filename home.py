    Riverbank filtration (RBF) can be considered as suitable alternative to direct groundwater (GW)
    abstraction for drinking water production. Surface water (SW) is infiltrating into the aquifer and
    undergoing filtration, sorption, and biodegradation processes along its flowpath to the RBF wells.
    This is leading to a reduction of costs of further water treatment. Although RBF has been
    successfully implemented in several countries including Germany, the development of this
    system including its sustainable application requires careful and precise planning. Of particular
    importance are aquifer-well interactions and GW-SW interaction through the riverbed.
